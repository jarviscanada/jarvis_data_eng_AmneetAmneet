**Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AmneetAmneet/tree/master/linux_sql)]: This project is a Linux-based monitoring agent designed to collect real-time hardware specifications and node resources. It encapsulates the monitoring process using Docker for isolation and persistence, ensuring seamless data collection and storage. The gathered data is stored in a PostgreSQL (PSQL) database for efficient retrieval and analysis. The primary users of this project are system administrators and IT professionals who need to monitor and manage Linux-based systems effectively. Technologies used in this project include CentOS, Bash/Shell scripting, Docker, RDBMS/SQL/PostgreSQL, crontab, and data analytics to ensure a robust and scalable monitoring solution
